# zProl

Z Programming Language that I made because I got bored.

Currently reworking a lot of things which might mean that some features will be removed for now, that might be re-added with a better implementation.

## Features
 - [X] [Order of operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations#Programming_languages) in math `== !=` `<< >>` `+ - &` `* / %` `=` `()`
 - [ ] Compiling to bytecode (Currently working on it)
 - [ ] Compiling to x86_64 Linux Assembly from bytecode
 - [ ] Compiling to x86_64 Windows Assembly from bytecode
